# Amazon Employee Access Challenge (Kaggle)



## Introduction

The problem statement is taken from Kaggle competition's Amazon Employee Access Challenge. When a new employee joins the company he or needs a variety of access to systems and portals at different levels depending on the designation, business unit, role etc of the employee.
There is a considerable amount of data regarding an employeeâ€™s role within an organization and the resources to which they have access. The data consists of real historical data collected from 2010 & 2011. Employees are manually allowed or denied access to resources over time.
The competition provides two files:
    1) train.csv - The training set. Each row has the ACTION (ground truth), RESOURCE, and
information about the employee's role at the time of approval
    2) test.csv - The test set for which predictions should be made. Each row asks whether an
employee having the listed characteristics should have access to the listed resource.

## 
We created three of machine learning models with different attributes and uploaded our result on Kaggle to check our model accruacies:
### 1) Shallow Model (RandomForestClassifier)
    

### 2) 3 Layer Neural Network Model

### 3) Deep (5 Layer) Neural Network Model
